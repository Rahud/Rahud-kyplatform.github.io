        <p>The youth are the most powerful in the Universe. The future holds something for the youth and they should not be worried about it.</p>
        

        <img class="image" src="youth20.jpg" alt="Image">
        <p>Our stages of growth are determined by our characters and we must not take this for granted. Keep in mind that the more you grow the harder things become. Avoid the bad peer groups and follow the right track. Just as you did when you were still 7.</p>

        <img class="image" src="youth32.jpg" alt="Image">
        <p>Our parents always are there to guide us where we go wrong so we should respect them no matter how hash they may sometimes be to you. Don't make your parents stressed about you at all times.</p>

        <img class="image" src="youth22.jpg" alt="Image">
        <p>Always believe in your personal dreams and avoid wet blankets about your dreams. Keep this in mind that the more that one friend discourages you is the more they get involoved in your personal life. Always look for those friends who are adding to your life goals.</p>

        <img class="image" src="youth23.jpg" alt="Image">
        <p>Let's make a Change <br> Let's make a Future <br> Look through what can be done to make your future bright and woderful. Keep your eyes up and stride forward.</p>

        <img src="youth46.jpg" alt="Image" class="image">
        <p>Your life has to be your top priority and secret.</p>
