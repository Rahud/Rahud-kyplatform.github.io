        <p>The youth are one of the most non-reliable people only because they are always lying for their survival.</p>

        <p>A youth relies on their mode of living not on the mode you expect them to be relying on! <b><i>Kigenyi Abdul Rahman</i></b> says "In the future most of the youth may fnid trouble as they struggle to live a new life from that they know grew up in, many may be fossed to join bad peer groups!"</p>

        <p>The youth <img src="youth31.jpg" alt="image"> together must enroll in co-curricular activities to gain relief from all the bad situations that they may encounter!</p>
